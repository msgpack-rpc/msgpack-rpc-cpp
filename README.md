# See [jubatus-msgpack-rpc/cpp](https://github.com/jubatus/jubatus-msgpack-rpc/tree/master/cpp) instead

This message pack-rpc-cpp repository is suspended due to some issue.

But thanks to an open-source project called [Jubatus](http://jubat.us/en/), msgpack-rpc-cpp is maintained as **jubatus-rpc**.
I recommend to check the repository instead:

https://github.com/jubatus/jubatus-msgpack-rpc/tree/master/cpp


Thanks, Sadayuki Furuhashi
